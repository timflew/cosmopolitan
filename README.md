As the world becomes more interconnected, the risk of cultural misunderstandings increases. Understanding what countries people are interested in and know about can consequently help us determine where there might be a high risk of faux pas. We measured people's knowledge of other countries by using Google Trends to compare how much countries are searched for and search for each other. In the figure above, we examined how much countries ("searcher") searched other countries ("searchee") (darker blue indicates the searcher Googled the searchee more).
